# Documentation Instructions

These instructions define standards for writing and maintaining documentation in Go projects.

## Requirements
- All exported functions, types, and packages must have GoDoc comments.
- Provide usage examples in GoDoc and in test files.
- Keep the `README.md` up to date with high-level usage, security notes, and references.
- Document any limitations, known issues, or deviations from standards.
- Reference official specifications (e.g., NIST, FIPS 140-3) where appropriate.

## Best Practices
- Use clear, concise language and avoid jargon.
- Organize documentation logically (overview, usage, security, references, etc.).
- Use Markdown formatting for all documentation files.
