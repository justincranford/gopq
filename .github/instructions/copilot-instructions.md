# Copilot/AI Code Generation Instructions

These instructions define how Copilot and other AI code generation tools should operate in this project.


Copilot must always follow all requirements and best practices in the other instructions files in this directory.


**Whenever instruction files or prompt files are added, deleted, renamed, or reorganized, you must:**
- Update `.vscode/settings.json` (or equivalent configuration) in the same commit/PR to ensure all references are accurate and up to date.
- Validate that all references to instruction files in settings and automation scripts are correct before considering the task complete.
- Do not mark the task as done or commit changes until this validation is performed.

**Checklist for instruction file changes:**
- [ ] Update all references in `.vscode/settings.json` and any other config files.
- [ ] Validate that all instruction file references are correct.
- [ ] Only mark the task as complete after validation.

Only include Copilot/AI-specific workflow, meta-instructions, and integration rules here.
