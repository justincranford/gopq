# Copilot/AI Code Generation Instructions

These instructions define how Copilot and other AI code generation tools should operate in this project.


Copilot must always follow all requirements and best practices in the other instructions files in this directory.

**Whenever instruction files or prompt files are added, deleted, renamed, or reorganized, always update `.vscode/settings.json` (or equivalent configuration) to ensure all references are accurate and up to date.**

Only include Copilot/AI-specific workflow, meta-instructions, and integration rules here.


# MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW RULES
