# Unit Test Instructions

These instructions guide Copilot and other code generation tools for unit test code in the gopq project.

## Requirements
- For all Go-specific requirements and best practices, see `go-instructions.md`.
- Cover all exported functions, positive and negative paths, boundary conditions, corner cases, and edge cases
- Include tests for invalid input, tampering, and error propagation
- Ensure coverage of both functional and non-functional requirements, including:
  - Customer-facing and user-facing APIs
  - Deployment, configuration, management, and decommissioning processes
  - Disaster recovery and business continuity scenarios
- Ensure all tests are deterministic and reproducible

## Example: Compliant Test Function

For a Go test example, see `go-instructions.md`.

## Best Practices
- For all Go-specific best practices, see `go-instructions.md`.
