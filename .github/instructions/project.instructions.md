# Project-Specific Instructions (gopq)

These instructions define requirements and standards unique to the gopq project.

## Requirements
- Implement and demonstrate NIST/FIPS-approved post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, Kyber, Dilithium, etc.).
- Reference official NIST/FIPS documentation in code and documentation.
- Provide comprehensive test coverage, including positive, negative, fuzz, and benchmark tests for all exported functions.
- Maintain a `README.md` with high-level usage, security notes, and references.

## Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive variable names and wrap all errors for traceability.
- Ensure all code passes linting and formatting before commit.
